wagtail-cache 1.0.0 release notes
=================================

There are no functionality changes for this release. However at this point
the package is mature and well tested enough to designate a 1.0 version.

* Support Django 3.0.
* Add unit tests, type hints, and continuous integration.

As a result of the unit tests, a few minor changes have been implemented under
the hood:

* Refactored ``wagtailcache.settings.wagtailcache_settings`` to be an object,
  similar to Django ``settings``, rather than a dictionary.
* Add ``wagtailcache.cache.Status`` and ``wagtailcache.cache.CacheControl``
  enums to replace hard-coded string values.
* Always set a "Cache-Control" header when skipping the cache to signal the
  caching decision to upstream caches.
