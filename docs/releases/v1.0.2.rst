1.0.2 release notes
===================

* Updated ``testproject`` to work with Wagtail 2.10+
* Removed deprecated ``wagtail.core.middleware.SiteMiddleware`` from the ``testproject``


**Additional Notes**: ``SiteMiddleware`` was deprecated in Wagtail v.2.9 because it clashes with 
Django's own site middleware. If this is left in your project when you upgrade
your Wagtail versions, it will cause potential failures in this package and may 
cause errors when running the server.
